# ARce-f1-challenge

IOS app which uses ARKit to interprets the world, and with the help of swiftUI and RealityKit, we render virtual objects.
The user is not only able to see digital data, also he/she can interact with them to generate an immersive replay experience.
Also, we used Oracle Cloud Infraestructure to host our back end services. With the usage of NodeJS and Express we develop a Rest API.
